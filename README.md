> This modpack contains some radical optimisations, so your Minecraft performance will be further improved!

> [!NOTE]
> **Support for this version has ended!** This version will not be further updated unless there are serious problems (e.g. crashes). You can still create your derivatives based on this branch.

## Getting Started

**Extremely Optimised requires a supported driver for the graphics card to work properly, see [Sodium's Driver Compatibility](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) to learn how to upgrade them.**

## Feature

Performance optimisations and bug fixes, that's all.

You can install this modpack on the server, but I would prioritise client-side optimisation over server-side.

## Got a problem?

Feel free to head over to the Discord server and ask me questions or fix crashes.

## About version number

Using `20.4.1` as an example, the first part `20` and the second part `4` are the major version numbers of Minecraft, which indicate which Minecraft version this release is based on.

The third part `1` is defined by the modpack itself and it is recommended that you keep it up to date to get the latest optimisations and bug fixes.

## Derivative projects

You are welcome to base your modifications on this modpack, which is packaged using Packwiz and hosted on GitHub, so it can be easily forked and modified.

You should also need to state that this modpack is based on Extremely Optimised, which is best linked back to this page.

**Need an example? [RE:Vanilla](https://modrinth.com/modpack/revanillaw) is a derivative of Extremely Optimised!**
